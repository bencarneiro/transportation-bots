# transportation-bots

This is a robot which takes real time traffic reports from the City of Austin Open Data Portal (https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Real-Time-Traffic-Incident-Reports/dx9v-zd7x)
And posts them with a picture of the intersection, and a link to the intersection on google maps. 

Built using Django // A Linode // Crontab // A Bash script

OK UPDATE 4/20:

This repo also now contains a lot of ETL code for NTD expenses timeseries, and performance timeseries as well. I'll eventually use this repo to build and API / site for visualizing transit data
